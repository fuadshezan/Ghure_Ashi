# Ghure Ashi
A web platform for travel lovers and general people where they can plan the fascinated tour
through this digital way. By using this platform we can book bus or hotel rooms or tour guide online, check
nearby tourist spots, search local popular restaurants, share your memories with others by writing blogs.

## Built With

This website built with some language and frameworks. They are:

- HTML 5
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- PHP
- Google Map API
- SSLCOMMERZ API
- Xampp



## Features

- Booking system
In travel time we need transportation, room for staying and tour guide to explore the place . In this system you can book tickets, rooms, tour guide just by searching the area or city name.
- Nearby places
Sometimes we can't explore the place due to lack of proper knowledge about the place. We don't know where to go or what food is famous for that place. So, you just input the city name and see the popular resturent where to eat or the places where to go. I use GOOGLE MAPS API for direction to the resturent and places for hassel free travelling.

## Lesson Learned

By doing this project I learned the use of SSLCOMMERZ API which is online payment gateway provider. For booking payment we use this payment system and it's a new experience for me.
